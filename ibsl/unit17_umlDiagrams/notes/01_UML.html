        <h1>UML Class Diagram Basics</h1>
        <p>A <strong>UML Class Diagram</strong> is an illustration of the relationships among classes in a object-oriented program (OOP) using the Unified Modeling Language (UML). A UML class diagram resembles a flowchart in which classes are portrayed as
            boxes, each box having three rectangles inside. The top rectangle contains the name of the class; the middle rectangle contains the attributes of the class; the lower rectangle contains the methods, also called operations, of the class. </p>

        <img src="images/UML/uml1.png" width="50%" height="50%">
        <p>*Attributes are also called properties, fields, or instance variables.<br> *Methods are also called operations or functions.</p>

        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p>Jessica and her older sister Jasmine have decided to buy a Food Truck. They are going to use a computer to track their daily food sales. Below is a UML class diagram for a class named <strong>Item</strong> used to represent items they will offer
            on their Food Truck menu.</p>

        <img src="images/UML/uml2.png" width="528" height="283" style="margin-left: 5opx">


        <p>The <i>Item</i> class defines 3 attributes: <strong>name</strong>, <strong>cost</strong>, and <strong>calories</strong>. Below is an example of an instance of the Item class.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top: 20px;">Visibility</h2>
        <p>In an UML diagram the visibility of an attribute or method is specified by a symbol in front of its name.</p>

        <h1>Class Relationships</h1>
        <p>There are several different kinds of relationships that exist among classes in an object-oriented program. They are inheritance, association, aggregation, and composition. Aggregation and composition are sub-types of the association relationship.</p>
        <ul id="csList">
            <li>Inheritance</li>
            <li>Association<br>
                <ul>
                    <li style="margin-left: 15px">Aggregation</li>
                    <li style="margin-left: 15px">Composition</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <div style="display: -webkit-flex; display: flex; align-items: baseline;">
            <h1>Inheritance Relationship</h1><img src="images/UML/uml6.png" width="70px" height="17px">
        </div>
        <p>An inheritance relationship between two classes is a relationship in which one class inherits or aquires the attributes and methods of another class. A class derived from another class is called a subclass or child class, whereas the class from
            which a subclass is derived is called a superclass or parent class. The inheritance relationship is an <strong>"is a"</strong> relationship. A dog is a pet. A mustang is a horse. Red is a color.</p>

        <p>Continuing with the Food Truck example below two new classes has been added to the UML Diagram named <strong>Food</strong> and <strong>Drink</strong> that are subclasses of the Item class. A <strong>white arrow</strong> is used to show an inheritance
            relationship in a UML diagram. The arrow points from a subclass to its inherited superclass.</p>
        <img src="images/UML/uml5.png " width="100% " height="100% " style="margin-left: 5opx ">

        <p></p>
        <div style="display: -webkit-flex; display: flex; align-items: baseline;">
            <h1>Association Relationship</h1><img src="images/UML/uml7.png" width="70px" height="17px">
        </div>
        <p>The association relationship is a way of describing that a class knows about another class or there exists some type of dependency between the two classes. An example of an association relationship is when one class contains a method that has
            a <strong>parameter</strong> of another class.

            <div id="apCode"><pre>public method printBattingAverage(BaseballPlayer player)
{
    double avg = player.getHits() / player.getAtBats();
}
</pre></div>

            <p>In an UML diagram the associative relationship is denoted by an arrow. The arrow is unidirectional showing which class knows about which class or which class uses which class.</p>

            <img src="images/UML/uml8.png " width="100% " height="100% " style="margin-left: 5opx ">
            <p>The association relationship can be divided into two categories: aggregration and composition.</p>
            <p></p>
            <div style="display: -webkit-flex; display: flex; align-items: baseline;">
                <h1>Aggregration Relationship</h1><img src="images/UML/uml9.png" width="70px" height="17px">
            </div>
            <p>Aggregation is a special form of association in which there is a stronger relationship between two classes. </p>
            When an object ‘has-a’ another object, then you have got an aggregation between them. Aggregation is also called a <strong>“has-a”</strong> relationship. An example of an aggregrative relationship is when one class is an <strong>instance variable</strong>            (field or property) of another class.

            <p>In an UML diagram the aggregation relationship is denoted by an arrow with an open diamond on the end. The direction of arrow specifies which object contains which object.</p>

            <img src="images/UML/uml10.png " width="100% " height="100%" style="margin-left: 5opx ">

            <div style="display: -webkit-flex; display: flex; align-items: baseline;">
                <h1>Composition Relationship</h1><img src="images/UML/uml11.png" width="70px" height="17px">
            </div>

            <p>A Composition relationship between two classes is a more restrictive form of an aggregative relationship. When an object contains the other object, if the contained object cannot exist without the existence of container object, then it is
                called composition. Example: A class contains students. A student cannot exist without a class, therefore there exists a composition relationship between class and students. The difference between aggregation and composition is that composition
                is more restrictive. When there is a composition between two objects, the composed object cannot exist without the other object. This restriction is not there in aggregation. In both aggregation and composition, direction is a must. The
                direction specifies, which object contains which object. </p>
            <img src="images/UML/uml12.png " width="100% " height="100% " style="margin-left: 5opx ">

            <p>In this example, a brain cannot exist without a human body. If the body dies so does the brain. The brain is dependent upon the body.</p>

            <h3>Aggregation vs Composition</h3>
            <p>Programmers are often confused as to whether a relationship is aggregation or composition. Composition is when one object owns another object while aggregation is when one object uses another object.</p>
            <p>Two phrases which come in handy when trying to determine whether an association between two classes is composition or aggregation are "part-of" and "has". If one object is-part-of another object e.g. Engine is part of Car, then the association
                or relationship between them is composition. On the other hand, if one object just has another object e.g. Car has the driver then it's aggregation.</p>

            <p>In Java, a composition association can be created by placing the keyword <strong>final</strong> in front of the composed object's variable declaration. Final makes an object reference unchangeable, however the object the variable points to
                can still be modified or changed. An object variable declared final can never refer to another object, but the object it refers to may change state.</p>
            <h1>Multiplicity</h1>
            <p>An association relationship between two classes may involve multiply objects, therefore the relationship between the two classes can take on many forms. Some examples include a one-to-one relationship, a zero-to-many relationship, a one-to-many
                relationship, and a many-to-many relationship. For example a class can have many students. A hotel can have many rooms. Many states can have many cities.</p>

            <p>In a UML diagram multiplicity between classes is denoted by placing numbers above the arrow that describes the relationship between two classes.</p>

            <h3>Example 1</h3>
            <img src="images/UML/uml13.png " width="100% " height="100% " style="margin-left: 5opx ">
            <p>This example shows that there is a one-to-one relationship between a human body and a brain. The human body can have one and only one brain.</p>

            <h3>Example 2</h3>
            <img src="images/UML/uml14.png " width="100% " height="100% " style="margin-left: 5opx ">
            <p>This example uses the notation <strong>0..*</strong> to denote a zero to many relationship. A baseball team can have zero or more players on the team. This type of relationship is often implemented using an array or ArrayList data structure.</p>
