This is a remake of the BWagner.org official site.

This was made so our teacher, BWagner, did not have to pay for the domain name anymore and to keep this websites existance permanent.

This would not be possible without the collaborators of:

* Jackson Sacharko
    * Ported over files 
    * debug work
* Timothy Stuart
    * Ported over images
    * debug work
    * fixed a 4,000 commit message

And special thanks to Mr. Wagner for being such a great teacher.


We are going to try to update this website and make it more efficient, but for now its functionality is way more important. If you find a way to make this better, like removing unneeded code, please submit a push request.

If you want to contact us please start by emailing bwagnerstorage@gmail.com. If we don't respond within a week you may email one of the following emails:
