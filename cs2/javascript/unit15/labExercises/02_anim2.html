<h1>Faulty Animation Loop</h1>
  <p>In the last lesson we looked at an animation loop that uses the Javascript function <strong>setInterval</strong> to
     execute code at recurring intervals. However, there are several problems with this approach. 
     Without going into much detail, the majority of these problems exist because the setInterval
     function lacks the ability to communicate with the browser, therefore it has no way of knowing what
     other events or operations are occurring in the browser at the same time. This lack of 
     knowledge can effect browser, therefore animation, performance. 
  </p>
  <h1>New and Improved Animation Loop</h1>
  <p>All of the shortcomings of the previous animation loop were eliminated with the introduction of a new Javascript function named <strong>requestAnimationFrame</strong>.
    The main benefit of the requestAnimationFrame function is that it has the ability to communicate with the browser thereby
    eliminating the performance issues caused by the setInterval method; resulting in much smoother animations.
  </p>

  <p>Below is a new and improved animation loop.</p>
  <div id="csOutput"><pre>var animate = new Animation();

// animation loop
function start() 
{
    requestAnimationFrame(start);
    animate.run();
}
start();   // invoke or call start function
</pre></div>

<p>You may have noticed that this animation loop does not specify a frame rate (fps).
   The requestAnimationFrame function is designed to run at 60 fps which is the optimum rate for rendering
   a browser window because the majority of computer monitors today have a refresh rate of 60Hz. The smoothest 
   animations occur when the frame rate (fps) and the refresh rate (Hz) are in sync. Incidentally, there are currently monitors
   that have frame rates of 165Hz, 180Hz, 200Hz, 240Hz. These are typically used with gaming units that have the memory
   and cpu/gpu power to handle higher frame rates than 60 fps.</p>
<p>Although requestAnimationFrame tries to render the browser window at 60 fps, if the browser
   cannot handle that speed for some reason, requestAnimationFrame can slow the frame rate down to accommodate the
   browser. Can you think of a reason why a browser may not be able to work efficiently with a frame
   rate of 60 fps?
</p>

<h1>Create Project</h1>
<ol id="csList">
    <li><p>Open Visual Studio. Click the <strong>File</strong> menu and select <strong>Open Folder...</strong>.
    <li><p>Navigate to the Animation folder you created in the previous lab
    and click the <strong>Select Folder</strong> button.</p></li>
    <li><p>In the EXPLORER tree click on the <strong>New Folder</strong> button. Create a new 
            folder named <strong>Animation2</strong>.</p></li>
    <li><p>Highlight the Animation2 folder and select the <strong>New Folder</strong> button and create a new folder 
            named <strong>js</strong>.</p>
    <li><p>Highlight the js folder and select the <strong>New File</strong> button and create a new file 
        named <strong>Animation2.js</strong> then add the following code.</p>
<div id="csCode" style="width:600px"><pre>class Animation
{
    constructor()
    {
        this.x = 0;       // x coordinate (horizontal)
        this.y = 320;     // y coordinate (vertical)
        this.vx = 1;      // horizontal velocity

        this.initialize();
    }

    // method initialize gets a reference to the canvas element 
    // and retrieves its context so that the program can draw
    // on the the canvas
    initialize()
    {
        this.context = document.getElementById("animationCanvas").getContext("2d");
    }

    // method update is called in the animation loop to continually update the animation
    // or game logic. In this method the location of the square that is being drawn
    // is being monitored so that when the square reaches an edge of the canvas
    // the square's horizontal direction is reversed.
    update() 
    {
        if(this.x > 640) 
            this.vx *= -1;       // flip direction: neg * pos is neg
        else if(this.x &lt; 0)
            this.vx *= -1;       // flip direction: neg * neg is pos

        this.x = this.x + this.vx;   // update horizontal location
    }

    // method draw is called in the animation loop to continually redraw the canvas so
    // that the location of the objects being animated in the canvas are updated.
    draw() 
    {
        this.context.strokeStyle = "#0000FF";   // choice drawing color
        this.context.clearRect(0,0,640,480);   // erase canvas first
        this.context.fillRect(this.x, this.y, 50, 50);   // then redraw square
    }

    // method run is called continually
    run() 
    {
        this.draw();
        this.update();  
    }
}

<li><p>Add a new file named <strong>index.html</strong> to the Animation2 folder then 
       add the following code.</p>
<div id="csCode"><pre>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;

        #animationCanvas {
            border: 3px black solid;
        }

    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;canvas id="animationCanvas" width="640" height="480"&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;

                animate.run();

<h1>Lab Exercise</h1>
<ol id="csList">
    <li><p>Open the <strong>index.html</strong> file in a browser. Can you tell a difference between the two animation loops?</p></li>  
    <li><p>Add the following code to the Animation class's constructor.</p>
    <div id="csOutput"><pre>this.vy = 1;      // vertical velocity</pre></div>    
    </li>
    <li><p>Modify the Animation class's <strong>update</strong> method so that the square can move both horizontally and
           vertically.</p></li>
    <li><p>Add two additional if statements to the <strong>update</strong> method so that the square will also bounce off the top and bottom edges of the
        canvas while it is moving.</p></li>
