<h1>Lesson</h1>
<p>Lesson 2-1 stated that there were two ways to display a web page locally in a browser 
   without first having to upload it to hosting site on the Internet. In this lesson you are going to use the second method 
   of a displaying an HTML file, which uses a local web server, also know as a development server.
</p>
<h3>Live Server</h3>
<p>Live Server is a simple web server that you can install as an extension in VS Code.
   (<strong>Note:</strong> Live Server was one of the extensions you were asked to
   install in the previous lesson.)</p>
<p>Follow these steps to view an HTML file using Live Server.</p>
<ol id="csList">
   <li><p>First the HTML file to be displayed must be open an editor window. 
        If not already open, open the file <strong>MyFirstHTML.html</strong> created in lesson 2-1 so that it
        appears in an editor window.
   </p></li>
   <li><p>Click the <strong>Go Live</strong> button located in the 
          editor's status bar.</p>

   <p>Live Server will launch a browser and send it the web page to
      be displayed. Any changes
      made to the HTML file while the server is running will 
      automatically be updated in the browser window.</p>
   <p>You can also start Live Server by right-clicking on the HTML file
         you would like to display and select <strong>Open with Live Server</strong>.
      </p>

   <li><p>To stop Live Server click the button in 
         status bar again which is now displaying the <strong>port number</strong>
         which the server is using to connect to the computer. If you would like to know about ports
