 <p>To help you better understand the use of constructors, accessor methods, mutator methods, and the
    toString method you will be doing a series of simple classes designed
    to give you practice in creating these special methods. These assignments are going to be fairly
    trivial so you can concentrate on the process of creating the methods. In this assignment you are
    going to implement two classes: a <strong>FarmAnimals</strong> class and a <strong>Farm</strong> class. 
	The Farm class will be a client
	of the FarmAnimals class. It will also contain the main method for the program.</p>
   <div id="csNote"><strong style="color:red">Replit Users:</strong> If you are using Replit you will need to rename the Farm class to <strong>Main</strong>. Replit requires that your program have a Main class.</div>
<h1>Directions</h1>
<h3>FarmAnimals class</h3>
<p>The FarmAnimals class is going to keep track of how many farm animals a farmer has on his farm.
   Specifically, you are going to track the number of cows, horses, pigs, and chickens on the farm. 
   On this first assignment, we will be walking through the process together.</p>

<p>Create a file named <strong>FarmAnimals.java</strong> and add the following code.</p>
<div id="csCode">
<pre>
public class FarmAnimals
{
   // instance variables
   
   // constructors
   
   // accessor methods
   
}
</pre>
</div>
<h3>Instance Variables</h3>
<p>The first step is to add our instance variables to the class. We will need a variable to store the
farmer's name and one variable for each animal. Add the following code to the instance variables section.</p>
<div id="csCode">
<pre>
private String name;      // The farmer's name
private int cows;         // number of cows
private int horses;       // number of horses
private int pigs;         // number of pigs
private int chickens;     // number of chickens</pre>
</div>

<h3>Constructors</h3>
<p>Next we are going to define two constructors for the class. Recall that a constructor is a
   special method designed to give initial values to the instance variables. By defining two
   constructors we make our class more flexible and easier to use.</p> 

<p>Here is the code for our first constructor. Add the code to the FarmAnimals class under the constructors section.</p>
<div id="csCode">
<pre>
public FarmAnimals()
{
  name = "";
  cows = 0;
  horses = 0;
  pigs = 0;
  chickens = 0;
}</pre>
</div>

<p>This constructor is called the <strong>default constructor</strong> since it does not have any 
   parameters in its parameter list. The default constructor typically sets the instance variables
   to default values like 0 and "" (the null string). The default constructor is called when you
   instantiate an object using the following format.</p>
<div id="csCode">
<pre>
FarmAnimals farm1 = new FarmAnimals();</pre>
</div>
  <p style="font-size:0.9em">*do not add this code to the FarmAnimals class. It is used 
    in the Farm class.</p>

<p>This code creates a FarmAnimals object, named farm1, and calls the default constructor
   to initialize its instance variables. It sets the instance 
   variables for that object to the following</p>
<div id="csOutput">
<pre>
name = "" 
cows = 0 
horses = 0 
pigs = 0 
chickens = 0</pre>
</div>

<p>Here is the code for our second constructor.</p>
<div id="csCode">
<pre>
public FarmAnimals(String n, int c, int h, int p, int ch)
{
  name = n;
  cows = c;
  horses = h;
  pigs = p;
  chickens = ch;
}
</pre>
</div> 

<p>We are providing this constructor, to the clients who use our class, so they have more flexibility
in the way they can instantiate FarmAnimals objects. Instead of just using the default constructor
which sets all of the instance variables to default values, they can use this constructor to provide
their own values to the instance variables. Here is an example of how they might use this constructor.</p>
<div id="csCode">
<pre>
FarmAnimals farm2 = new FarmAnimals("John Chisum", 50, 12, 5, 10);</pre>
</div>
 <p style="font-size:0.9em">*do not add this code to the FarmAnimals class. It is used 
    in the Farm class.</p>
<p>This constructor will instaniate a FarmAnimals object, named farm2, and set the instance 
   variables for that object to the following</p>
<div id="csOutput">
<pre>
name = "John Chisum" 
cows = 50 
horses = 12
pigs = 5 
chickens = 10</pre>
</div>

<h3>Accessor Method</h3>
<p>Accessor methods provide clients access to the instance variables of a class so that they can
   see the contents of the instance variables. There are 5 instance variables in the FarmAnimals
   class so we will include 5 accessor methods. Add the following code to the FarmAnimals class
   under the accessor methods section.</p>
<div id="csCode">
<pre>
public String getName()
{
   return name;
}

public int getCows()
{
   return cows;
}

public int getHorses()
{
   return horses;
}

public int getPigs()
{
   return pigs;
}

public int getChickens()
{
   return chickens;
}</pre>
</div>
<div id="csNote"><strong>Note:</strong> if there is an instance variable that you don't want clients to have access
   to(Ex. a password), then don't provide an accessor method for that variable.</div>

<h3>Client Program - Farm class</h3>
<p>The purpose of the Farm class is to test the functionality of the FarmAnimals class. To do this it
   instantiates two FarmAnimals objects and then displays information about each object.</p>
<p>Create a file named <strong>Farm.java</strong> and add the following code.</p>
<div id="csNote"><strong style="color:red">Replit Users:</strong> If you are using Replit you will need to rename the Farm.java file to <strong>Main.java</strong>. Replit requires that your program have a file named Main.java.</div>
<div id="csCode">
<pre>
public class Farm
{
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {

   }	
}</pre>
</div>
<p>The first step is to instantiate two FarmAnimals objects.
   The first object, farm1, is instantiated using the default constructor, the second object, farm2,
   is instantiated using the second constructor. Add the following code to the Farm class's main method.</p> 
<div id="csCode">
<pre>
FarmAnimals farm1 = new FarmAnimals();
FarmAnimals farm2 = new FarmAnimals("John Chisum", 50, 12, 5, 10);</pre>
</div>   
<p>The next step is to display the information about each farm. To do this we are going to utilize the
   <strong>accessor methods</strong> of FarmAnimals class. Add the following code.</p>
<div id="csCode">
<pre>
System.out.println("****************************");
System.out.println("  Test Default Constructor");
System.out.println("****************************");
System.out.println("Farmer Name : " + farm1.getName());       // call accessor methods
System.out.println("Cows        : " + farm1.getCows());
System.out.println("Horses      : " + farm1.getHorses());
System.out.println("Pigs        : " + farm1.getPigs());
System.out.println("Chickens    : " + farm1.getChickens());
System.out.println();
System.out.println("****************************");
System.out.println("    Test 2nd Constructor");
System.out.println("****************************");
System.out.println("Farmer Name : " + farm2.getName());
System.out.println("Cows        : " + farm2.getCows());
System.out.println("Horses      : " + farm2.getHorses());
System.out.println("Pigs        : " + farm2.getPigs());
System.out.println("Chickens    : " + farm2.getChickens());
System.out.println();
</pre>
</div>
