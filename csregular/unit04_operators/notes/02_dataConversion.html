  <h1>Data Conversion</h1>
  <p>Because Java is a strongly typed language, each data value is associated with a particular type.
     It is sometimes helpful or necessary to convert a data value of one type to another type, but 
	 we must be careful that we don't lose important information in the process. For example, suppose
	 a double variable that holds the number 23.45 is converted to an int value. Because an int cannot
	 store the fractional part of a number, some information would be lost in the conversion, and the
	 number represented in the int would not keep its original value.</p>
  <p>A conversion between one primitive type and another falls into one of two categories: <strong>widening
     conversions</strong> and <strong>narrowing conversions</strong>. Widening conversions are the safest because they usually
     do not lose information. Converting from an int to a double is a widening conversion.</p>
  <p>Narrowing conversions are more likely to lose information than widening conversions. Therefore,
     in general, they should be avoided. Converting from a double to an int is a narrowing conversion.</p>
  <p>Note the boolean values are not mentioned in either widening or narrowing conversions. A boolean
     value (true or false) cannot be converted to any other primitive type and vice versa.</p>
  <p>In Java, conversions can occur in three ways:</p>
  <div id="csList">
  <ul>
    <li>assignment conversion</li>
    <li>arithmetic conversion</li>
    <li>casting</li>
  </ul></div>
  <h1>Assignment Conversion</h1>
  <p>Assignment conversion happens when a value of one type is assigned to a variable of another 
     type and the value is converted to the new type. Only widening conversions can be done this
	 way. For example, if money is a double variable and dollars is an int variable, then the 
	 following assignment statement automatically converts the value in dollars to a double:</p>
   <div id="csCode">
   <pre>
double money = 0.0;
int dollars = 25;

money = dollars;</pre>
</div>
   <p>So, if dollars contains the value 25, after the assignment, money contains the value 25.0.
      However, if we try to go the other way around and assign money to dollars, the compiler will
	  send an error message saying that a narrowing conversion could lose information. If you really
	  want to do this assignment, you can do something called casting, which we'll get to in a minute.</p>
    <h1>Arithmetic Conversion</h1>
	<p>Arithmetic promotion happens automatically when certain arithmetic operators need to change
	   their operands in order to perform the operation. For example, when a floating point value
	   called sum is divided by an integer value called count, the value of count becomes a floating
	   point value automatically, before the division takes place, producing a floating point result:</p>
	  <div id="csCode">
   <pre>
double sum = 30;
int count = 3;
double result = sum / count;     <div id="csComment"><pre>// count is cast to double</pre></div></pre> </div>
    <h1>Casting</h1>
	<p>Casting is the most general form of conversion in Java. If a conversion can be done at all
	   in a Java program, it can be done using a cast. A <strong>cast</strong> is a type name in parentheses, placed
	   in front of the value to be converted. For example, to convert money to an integer value, we
	   could put a cast in front of it:</p>
	 <div id="csCode">
    <pre>
double money = 84.69;
int dollars = 0;

dollars = <div id="csHighlight"><pre>(int)</pre></div>money;</pre>
     </div>
	<p>The cast returns the value in money, cutting off a fractional part. If money contained the
	   value 84.69, then after the assignment, dollars would contain the value 84. Note, however, 
	   that the cast does not change the value in money. After the assignment operation is complete,
	   money still contains the value 84.69.</p>
	<p>Casts are helpful when a value needs to be treated as another type. For example, if we want
	   to divide the integer value total by the integer value count and get a floating point, we
	   could do it as follows:</p>
	 <div id="csCode">
    <pre>
result = <div id="csHighlight"><pre>(double)</pre></div>total / count;</pre>
     </div>
   <p>First, the cast operator returns a floating point version of the value in total. This operation
      does not change the value in total. Then, count is treated as a floating point value by arithmetic
	  promotion. Now the division operator will do floating point division. If the cast had not been
	  included, the operation would have done integer division and cut the fraction off before assigning
	  it to result. Also note that because the cast operator has a higher precedence than the division<br>
      operator, the cast operates on the value of total, not on the result of the division.</p>
    <p>The table below shows a modified version of the order of operations with the cast operator included.</p>
