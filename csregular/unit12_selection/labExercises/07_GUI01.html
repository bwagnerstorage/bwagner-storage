<h1>Directions</h1>
  <p>To this point, you have written programs that take input from the keyboard, do some processing,
    and then display the results on a console screen. Most modern programs, however, don't work this
    way. This lesson will introduce you to another type of program called <strong>graphical user interface</strong>
	or <strong>GUI</strong>. In a GUI program you start with a window called a frame and you add graphical components
    like labels, buttons, textfield, combo boxes, menus, and others. A GUI program is called an 
	event-driven program because it responds to events initiated by the user like pressing a button,
    typing in a text field, or selecting a menu option.</p>
   <p>The code below creates a Java GUI application program and displays its frame window. This code
      will be the template we will use to create all of our GUI programs.</p>
   <div id="csCode">

{
    <font color="#FF00FF">// constructor</font>

    }
    
    <font color="#FF00FF">// main method</font>
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        GUI01 app = new GUI01();    <font color="#FF00FF">// run program</font>
    }
}</pre>
   </div>
   <p>Since we will be using this code in all of our GUI programs lets break it apart and learn what each part does.</p>
<h3>import Statement</h3>
<p>Let's start with the import command. The import command allows your program access to classes that
   are not in your project. Java developers have written hundreds of classes to inable you to create
   GUI programs. Most of the classes fall under what Java developers call the Swing classes and they
   can be accessed by including the following imports at the top of your program.</p>
      <div id="csCode">
    <pre>
import java.util.*;
import java.awt.*;
import javax.swing.*;
import java.awt.event.*;</pre>
   </div>
   <h3>Inheritance</h3>
   <p>The next line of code is the program's class declaration with the keyword <strong>extends</strong> and the
     class name JFrame appended to the end. The JFrame class is one of the swing classes and its
	 purpose is to create a GUI program's frame window. By adding the code <strong>extends JFrame</strong> to the
	 end of the class declaration we are utilizing a powerful programming mechanism called
	 <strong>inheritance</strong>. (Inheritance is a topic we will cover in much greater detail in later unit.) </p>
      <div id="csCode">
    <pre>
public class GUI01 <font color="#FF0000">extends</font> JFrame</pre>
   </div>
   <p>The idea of inheritance is simple but powerful: When you want to create a new class and there is
      already a class that includes some of the code that you want, you can derive your new class from 
	  the existing class. In doing this, you can use the methods of the existing class without having to
	  write them yourself. </p>
   <p>Writing the code for your own frame window would be a very complex process. However, through
      inheritance, it becomes fairly trivial. All you have to do is extend or inherit the JFrame class
	  and your program automatically has the ability to create a frame window and you also have access
	  to a whole list of methods that can be used to manipulate the attributes of the window. 
	  In essence, your class becomes a JFrame class.</p>
<h3>Constructor</h3>
<p>A <strong>constructor</strong> is a special method that has the same name as the class it is defined in. Below is 
   the declaration for our constructor. Notice the class is named GUI01 and the name of the
   constructor is also GUI01.</p>
   <div id="csCode">
    <pre>
public class <font color="#FF0000">GUI01</font> extends JFrame
{
    // constructor
    public <font color="#FF0000">GUI01</font>()
    {
	
</pre>
   </div>
   <p>Every GUI program we write will include a constructor. The constructor is important because it
      will contain the majority of the code we write for our GUI programs.</p>
 <h3>JFrame Methods</h3>
 <p>All of the lines of code contained within the constructor reference methods of the JFrame class 
    that became accessible through inheritance.</p>
 <p>The first JFrame method is called <strong>setLayout</strong>. Layouts are used to automatically
   position components within a frame. We will not be using layouts so the line of code below is 
   setting the layout of the frame to null.</p>
      <div id="csCode">
    <pre>setLayout(null);</pre>
   </div>
 <p>The second JFrame method called within the constructor is <strong>setSize</strong>. This method 
    sets the initial size of frame when it is displayed on the screen. The line of code below sets
    the dimension of the frame to 500 pixels across by 500 pixels down. The default size of a frame
    is (0,0) so you need to use this method to give your frame an initial size.</p>
	<div id="csCode">
    <pre>setSize(500, 500);</pre>
   </div>
   <p>The next JFrame method is <strong>setDefaultCloseOperation</strong>. This method is used to 
      determine what happens to the program when a user presses the "x" icon in the upper right hand
	  corner of your frame window. The line of code below causes the program to terminate when the "x" is
	  pressed.</p>
	  	<div id="csCode">
    <pre>setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);</pre>
   </div>
   <p>The next JFrame method is <strong>setBackground</strong>. This method sets the background color
      for your frame window. The default frame color is gray. Java has preset colors that can be 
	  accessed using the Color class.</p>
	 <div id="csCode">
    <pre>getContentPane().setBackground(Color.white);</pre>
   </div>
   <p>Notice the reference to the method <strong>getContentPane</strong> in the code above. The frame window within
      a Java application is actually made up of several layers or panes. 
  <p>In our GUI programs we are only concerned with the content pane layer. To gain access to this
     pane you use the method getContentPane, which returns a reference to the current frame's content 
	 pane object. The line of code</p>
	 	 <div id="csCode">
    <pre><font color="#FF0000">getContentPane</font>().setBackground(Color.white);</pre>
   </div>
   <p>is actually changing the background color of the content pane not the frame itself. Later on
     when we want to add components like buttons or textfields to a frame we will actually be adding 
	 them to content pane.</p>
	 <p>The last JFrame method called within the constructor is setVisible. This method determines
	    whether the frame window is visible when the program is executed.. By default a frame is
	    invisible so you will need to call this method with an argument of true.</p>
   <div id="csCode">
    <pre>setVisible(true);</pre>
   </div>
   <h3>main Method</h3>
   <p>Java Application programs must contain a main method. The code below is the main method for our template class.</p>
	     <div id="csCode">
    <pre>// main method
public static void main(String[] args)
{
    GUI01 app = new <font color="#FF0000">GUI01()</font>;  // run program
}
</pre>
   </div>
   <p>The code highlighted in red is a call made to the constructor method discussed above. When the
      program is executed the constructor is called which builds the frame window and sets all of its
	  attributes like size, color, etc.</p>
   <p>Every GUI program will have a main method similar to this one with the appropriate name.</p>
   <h1>Exercise</h1>
   <p>There are two sets of instructions depending upon whether you are using Replit or Netbeans as your IDE (editor).

{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        GUI01 app = new GUI01();    // run program
    }
}
</pre></div>
</li>
<li><p>Run the program.</p></li>
</ol>

   <h3>NetBeans</h3>
   <div id="csList">
