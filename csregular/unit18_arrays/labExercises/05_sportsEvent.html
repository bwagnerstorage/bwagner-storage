<h1>Directions</h1>
  <p>In many sports events, judges rate contestants with an average score being determined by 
     discarding the lowest and highest scores and averaging the remaining scores.</p>
  <p>Write a program which allows eight scores to be entered, discards the lowest and
      highest scores, then computes an average score for the contestant. Your program should
	 display the eight entered scores, the average score, and the two discarded scores.</p>

<p>You are going to complete 2 void methods and 3 non-void methods. Do not
   make any modifications to the main method.</p>
<h3>Method readScores</h3>
<p>Complete the method <strong>readScores</strong> shown below. This method 
   prompts the user to enter in 8 scores and stores them in the array scores.</p>
 <div id="csOutput">
<pre>
Enter Eight Contestant Scores:
Judge 1 --> 9.2
Judge 2 --> 9.5
Judge 3 --> 9.5
Judge 4 --> 9.1
Judge 5 --> 9.7
Judge 6 --> 9.6
Judge 7 --> 9.7
Judge 8 --> 9.6

</div>
<div id="csCode">
<pre>
/* This method prompts the user to enter in 8 scores and stores
 * them in the array scores.
 */
public void readScores()
{

}
</pre>
</div>

<h3>Method lowest</h3>
<p>Complete the method <strong>lowest</strong> shown below. This method 
   returns the lowest score in scores.</p> 
<div id="csCode">
<pre>
/* Determines which score in scores is the lowest
 * @return the lowest score in scores
 */
public double lowest()

}
</pre>
</div>
<p>Java's Double class provides a useful constant that can be used when implementing the lowest method.
   The constant MAX_VALUE contains the largest value that can be represented in a double variable.
   In your implementation of the lowest method you will need to declare a local variable that stores the current lowest
   value in the array. The starting value for this variable needs to be larger than every value in the array.
   You can guarantee that this value is the largest by setting it to MAX_VALUE. Here is
   sample code that demonstrates the use of MAX_VALUE.</p>
   
<div id="csCode">
<pre>
double lowest = Double.MAX_VALUE;
</pre>
</div>
<p>MAX_VALUE is declared <strong>static</strong> in the Integer class therefore it is accessed using dot notation and the class name.</p> 
<h3>Method highest</h3>
<p>Complete the method <strong>highest</strong> shown below. This method 
   returns the highest score in scores.</p>
<p>You can use the Double class's MIN_VALUE constant in your implementation.</p>
<div id="csCode">
<pre>
/* Determines which score in scores is the lowest
 * @return the highest score in scores
 */
public double highest()
{
        
}
</pre>
</div>

<h3>Method average</h3>
<p>Complete the method <strong>average</strong> shown below. This method 
   calculates the average of scores with the lowest and highest scores
   thrown out. This method needs to make calls to the methods <strong>lowest</strong>
   and <strong>highest</strong>.</p>
<div id="csCode">
<pre>
/* Calculates the average of scores with the lowest and highest scores
 * thrown out.
 * @return the average
 */
public double average()

<h3>Method printScores</h3>
<p>Complete the method <strong>printScores</strong> shown below. This method 
   prints each value stored in the array scores on the console window 
   horizontally with a space between each value. It also includes the heading
   "Scores = ".
 <div id="csOutput">
<pre>
Scores = 9.2 9.5 9.5 9.1 9.7 9.6 9.7 9.6

 *   across screen with a space between each one.
 */
 public void printScores()
 {

 }
</pre>
</div>

<h3>Method printSummary</h3>
<p>Complete the method <strong>printSummary</strong> shown below. This method 
   prints a summary report which includes the original list of scores, the lowest score,
   the highest score, the average of the scores. This method needs to make calls to the
   methods <strong>lowest</strong>, <strong>highest</strong>, and <strong>average</strong>.</p>
 <div id="csOutput">
