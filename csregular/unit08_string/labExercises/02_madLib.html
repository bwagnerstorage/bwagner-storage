<h1>Directions</h1>
  <p>A Mad Lib is a funny, often ridiculous story created when you fill in the blanks with the
     part of speech that is requested. Most word descriptions will ask for simple parts of speech,
	 like a noun, verb, adjective, adverb, and more. Sometimes the description will ask for a body
	 party, a number, the name of someone you know. All these different descriptions give you an
	 opportunity to really be creative.</p>
  <p>Write a program that creates a Mad Lib for the theme song to the TV show Gilligan's Island.
     Start by prompting the user to enter word descriptions with the part of speech indicated that
	 will be used to fill in parts of the song. Once all of the word descriptions have been entered,
	 display the song with the users words inserted.</p>
  <p>The song below is marked with numbers indicating where the user's responses will be inserted
     into the song. [1] indicates the first word entered by user.</p>

         GILLIGAN`S ISLAND THEME

Just sit right back and you`ll hear a tale,
A tale of a fateful toothbrush,
That started from this tropic port,
Aboard this tiny skateboard.

The mate was a scary sailor man,
The skipper large and sure.
Five polish sausages set sail that day,
For a 3 hour adventure, a 3 hour adventure.

The weather started getting immense,
The tiny skateboard was scared,
If not for the monkey of the fearless crew,
The elephant would be lost, the elephant would be lost.

The skateboard set ground on the shore of this uncharted desert isle,
With Gilligan, The Skipper too,
The millionaire and his guitar, The movie trash can, 
And The Rest, Here on Gilligan`s Isle.
