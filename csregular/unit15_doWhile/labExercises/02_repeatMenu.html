<h1>Directions</h1>
  <p>Write a program that allows a user to choose from a menu of options like the sample run below.
     If the user does not select one of the choices on the menu have the program display the menu again
	 and ask the user to make another selection. The program should repeat this process
	 until the user has selected a valid option. Once a valid option has been selected, the program
	 should display the user's selection.</p>
	 
  <p>Copy the following code into your source file.</p>

<h3>Method displayMenu</h3>
<p>Complete the method <strong>displayMenu</strong> shown below. This method displays

</div>
<p>After displaying the menu the method waits for the user to select one of the menu 
   options. If the user's selection is not a valid number, in the range of 1 to 5 inclusive,
   the method displays the menu again and waits for user to make another selection.
   This process is repeated until a valid selection is made. The method finishes by
   returning the user's selection. This method will need a local Scanner object.</p>

<h3>Method printSelection</h3>
<p>Complete the method <strong>printSelection</strong> shown below. This method makes
a call to the method <strong>displayMenu</strong> so that the user's menu selection can
 be retrieved. Once the user's selection has been determined the method displays a 
message like the following</p>
<div id="csOutput">
<pre>
You have chosen Sprite
</pre>
</div>
where Sprite is the name of the menu item selected by the user.

<p>When calling the method displayMenu store the return value in a local integer variable
   like the following code:</p>
<div id="csCode"><pre>
int selection = displayMenu();
</pre></div>
<p>You can then use this variable in a series of if statements to determine the
   name of the menu item selected.</p>
