<h1>Directions</h1>
<p>An appointment scheduling system is represented by the following three classes: TimeInterval, Appointment, and DailySchedule. 
In this question, you will implement one method in the Appointment class and two methods in the DailySchedule class.</p>

<p>A TimeInterval object represents a period of time. The TimeInterval class provides a method to determine if
 another time interval overlaps with the time interval represented by the current TimeInterval object. An Appointment
  object contains a time interval for the appointment and a method that determines if there is a time conflict between
   the current appointment and another appointment. The declarations of the TimeInterval and Appointment classes are shown below.</p>
<div id="apCode"><pre>
public class TimeInterval
{
      // returns true if interval overlaps with this TimeInterval;
      // otherwise, returns false
      <div id="apHighlight"><pre>public boolean overlapsWith(TimeInterval interval)</pre></div>
      { /* implementation not shown */ }

      // There may be fields, constructors, and methods that are not shown.

}

public class Appointment
{
      // returns the time interval of this Appointment
      <div id="apHighlight"><pre>public TimeInterval getTime()</pre></div>
      { /* implementation not shown */ }

      // returns true if the time interval of this Appointment
      // overlaps with the time interval of other;
      // otherwise, returns false
      <div id="apHighlight"><pre>public boolean conflictsWith(Appointment other)</pre></div>
      { /* to be implemented in part (a) */ }

    // There may be fields, constructors, and methods that are not shown.

}
</pre></div>
<div id="csList2"><ol>
<li><p>Write the Appointment method <strong>conflictsWith</strong>. If the time interval of the current appointment
overlaps with the time interval of the appointment other, method conflictsWith should return true, otherwise, it should return false.</p>

<p>Complete method <strong>conflictsWith</strong> below.</p>
<div id="apCode" style="width:600px"><pre>
// returns true if the time interval of this Appointment
// overlaps with the time interval of other;
// otherwise, returns false
<div id="apHighlight"><pre>public boolean conflictsWith(Appointment other)</pre></div>


</pre></div> 
</li>
<li><p>A DailySchedule object contains a list of nonoverlapping Appointment objects. 
The DailySchedule class contains methods to clear all appointments that conflict with a given appointment and to add an appointment to the schedule.</p>
<div id="apCode" style="width:600px"><pre>
public class DailySchedule
{
      // contains Appointment objects, no two Appointments overlap
      <div id="apHighlight"><pre>private ArrayList&lt;Appointment&gt; apptList;</pre></div>

      <div id="apHighlight"><pre>public DailySchedule()</pre></div>
      { 
	      apptList = new ArrayList&lt;Appointment&gt;();
      }
	  
      // removes all appointments that overlap the given Appointment
      // postcondition: all appointments that have a time conflict with
      //appt have been removed from this DailySchedule
      <div id="apHighlight"><pre>public void clearConflicts(Appointment appt)</pre></div>
      { /* to be implemented in part (b) */ }
	  
      // if emergency is true, clears any overlapping appointments and adds
      // appt to this DailySchedule; otherwise, if there are no conflicting
      // appointments, adds appt to this DailySchedule;
      // returns true if the appointment was added;
      // otherwise, returns false
      <div id="apHighlight"><pre>public boolean addAppt(Appointment appt, boolean emergency)</pre></div>
      { /* to be implemented in part (c) */ }
	  
	  
      // There may be fields, constructors, and methods that are not shown.
	  
}</pre></div>
<p>Write the DailySchedule method <strong>clearConflicts.</strong> Method clearConflicts removes all appointments that conflict with the given appointment.</p>

<p>In writing method clearConflicts, you may assume that <strong>conflictsWith</strong> works as specified, regardless of what you wrote in part (a).</p>

<p>Complete method <strong>clearConflicts</strong> below.</p>
<div id="apCode" style="width:600px"><pre>
// removes all appointments that overlap the given Appointment
// postcondition: all appointments that have a time conflict with
//appt have been removed from this DailySchedule
<div id="apHighlight"><pre>public void clearConflicts(Appointment appt)</pre></div>
 
 
</pre></div></li>
<li><p>Write the DailySchedule method <strong>addAppt</strong>. The parameters to method addAppt are an appointment and a boolean
 value that indicates whether the appointment to be added is an emergency. If the appointment is an emergency, the
  schedule is cleared of all appointments that have a time conflict with the given appointment and the appointment
   is added to the schedule. If the appointment is not an emergency, the schedule is checked for any conflicting appointments.
   If there are no conflicting appointments, the given appointment is added to the schedule. Method addAppt returns true if
    the appointment was added to the schedule; otherwise, it returns false.</p>

<p>In writing method addAppt, you may assume that <strong>conflictsWith</strong> and <strong>clearConflicts</strong> work as specified, regardless of what you wrote in parts (a) and (b).</p>

<p>Complete method <strong>addAppt</strong> below.</p>
<div id="apCode" style="width:600px"><pre>
// if emergency is true, clears any overlapping appointments and adds
// appt to this DailySchedule; otherwise, if there are no conflicting
// appointments, adds appt to this DailySchedule;
// returns true if the appointment was added;
// otherwise, returns false
<div id="apHighlight"><pre>public boolean addAppt(Appointment appt, boolean emergency)</pre></div>


</pre></div>

<h1>Sample Run</h1>
<div id="csSampleRun">
<pre>
Appointment 1     1000 1999
Appointment 2     2000 2999
Appointment 3     3000 3999
Appointment 4     4000 4999
Appointment 5     5000 5999

Appointment 6 conflicts with Appointment 3.
Since it is an emergency Appointment 6 is added
and Appointment 3 is removed.

Appointment 1     1000 1999
Appointment 2     2000 2999
Appointment 4     4000 4999
Appointment 5     5000 5999
Appointment 6     3100 3500

Appointment 7 conflicts with both Appointment 1 and Appointment 2.
Since it is an emergency Appointment 7 is added
and Appointment 1 and Appointment 2 are removed.

Appointment 4     4000 4999
Appointment 5     5000 5999
Appointment 6     3100 3500
Appointment 7     1999 2001

***Appointment 8 was not added***

Appointment 8 conflicts with Appointment 5.
However, it is not an emergency so it is not added
and Appointment 5 is not removed.

Appointment 4     4000 4999
Appointment 5     5000 5999
Appointment 6     3100 3500
Appointment 7     1999 2001
