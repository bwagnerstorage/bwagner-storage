   * (month, day, year), where 0 denotes Sunday, 1 denotes Monday, ...,
   * and 6 denotes Saturday.
   * Precondition: The date represented by month, day, year is a valid date.

   <span id="apHighlight"><pre>public static int dayOfWeek(int month, int day, int year)</pre></span>
   { /* to be implemented in part (b) */ }

   // There may be instance variables, constructors, and other methods not shown.
   }</pre></div>

   <h3>Part (a)</h3>
   <p>Write the static method <span class="cd">numberOfLeapYears</span>, which returns the number of leap years between <span class="cd"></span>year1</span> and <span class="cd"></span>year2</span>, inclusive.</p>
   <p>In order to calculate this value, a helper method is provided for you.</p>
   <ul id="csList">
       <li><span class="cd">isLeapYear(year)</span> returns true if year is a leap year and false otherwise.</li>
   </ul>
   <br>
   <p>Complete method numberOfLeapYears below. You must use isLeapYear appropriately to receive full credit.</p>
   <div id="apCode"><pre> /** Returns the number of leap years between year1 and year2, inclusive.
   * Precondition: 0 <= year1 <= year2
   */
   public static int numberOfLeapYears(int year1, int year2)




</pre>
   </div>
   
   <h3>Part (b)</h3>
   <p>Write the static method <span class="cd">dayOfWeek</span>, which returns the integer value representing the day of the week for the given date (month, day, year), where 0 denotes Sunday, 1 denotes Monday, ..., and 6
   denotes Saturday. For example, 2019 began on a Tuesday, and January 5 is the fifth day of 2019. As a result,
   January 5, 2019, fell on a Saturday, and the method call dayOfWeek(1, 5, 2019)
   returns 6.</p>
   <p>As another example, January 10 is the tenth day of 2019. As a result, January 10, 2019, fell on a Thursday, and the method call dayOfWeek(1, 10, 2019) returns 4.</p>
   <p>In order to calculate this value, two helper methods are provided for you.</p>
   <ul id="csList">
   <li><p><span class="cd">firstDayOfYear(year)</span> returns the integer value representing the day of the week for the first day of year, where <span class="cd">0</span> denotes Sunday, 1 denotes Monday, ..., and <span class="cd">6</span> denotes Saturday. For example, since 2019 began on a Tuesday, 
   <span class="cd">firstDayOfYear(2019)</span> returns <span class="cd">2</span>.</p></li>
   <li><p>
    <span class="cd">dayOfYear(month, day, year)</span> returns <span class="cd">n</span>, where <span class="cd">month</span>, <span class="cd">day</span>, and <span class="cd">year</span> specify the nth day of the year. For the first day of the year, January 1
    <span class="cd">(month = 1, day = 1)</span>, the value 1 is returned. This method accounts for whether year is a leap year. For example,<br> <span class="cd">dayOfYear(3, 1, 2017)</span> returns <span class="cd">60</span>, since 2017 is not a leap year, while<br> <span class="cd">dayOfYear(3, 1, 2016)</span> returns <span class="cd">61</span>, since 2016 is a leap year.</p></li></ul>
     <br>

    <p>Complete method <span class="cd">dayOfWeek</span> below. You must use <span class="cd">firstDayOfYear</span> and <span class="cd">dayOfYear</span> appropriately to receive full credit.</p>

<div id="apCode"><pre>/** Returns the value representing the day of the week for the given date
 * (month, day, year), where 0 denotes Sunday, 1 denotes Monday, ...,
