<h1>Directions</h1>
<p>A grayscale image is represented by a 2-dimensional rectangular array of pixels (picture elements). A pixel is an
integer value that represents a shade of gray. In this question, pixel values can be in the range from 0 through
255, inclusive. A black pixel is represented by 0, and a white pixel is represented by 255.</p>
<p>The declaration of the GrayImage class is shown below. You will write two unrelated methods of the
GrayImage class.</p>
<img src="images/GrayScale1.png">

<div id="csList2">
<ol>
<li><p>Write the method <strong>countWhitePixels</strong> that returns the number of pixels in the image that contain the
value WHITE. For example, assume that pixelValues contains the following image.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="images/GrayScale2.png"></div>

<p>A call to countWhitePixels method would return 5 because there are 5 entries (shown in boldface)
that have the value WHITE.</p>

<p>Complete method <strong>countWhitePixels</strong> below.</p>
<div id="apCode" style="width:550px"> <pre>
/** @return the total number of white pixels in this image.
 *  Postcondition: this image has not been changed.
 */
<div id="apHighlight"><pre>public int countWhitePixels()</pre></div> 


 
</pre></div>
</li>
<li><p>Write the method processImage that modifies the image by changing the values in the instance
variable pixelValues according to the following description. The pixels in the image are processed one
at a time in row-major order. Row-major order processes the first row in the array from left to right and then
processes the second row from left to right, continuing until all rows are processed from left to right. The
first index of pixelValues represents the row number, and the second index represents the column
number.</p>
<p>The pixel value at position (row, col) is decreased by the value at position (row + 2, col + 2) if such a
position exists. If the result of the subtraction is less than the value BLACK, the pixel is assigned the value
of BLACK. The values of the pixels for which there is no pixel at position (row + 2, col + 2) remain
unchanged. You may assume that all the original values in the array are within the range
[BLACK, WHITE], inclusive.</p>
<p>The following diagram shows the contents of the instance variable pixelValues before and after a call
to processImage. The values shown in boldface represent the pixels that could be modified in a
grayscale image with 4 rows and 5 columns.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="images/GrayScale2.png"></div><br>

Complete method <strong>processImage</strong> below.

<div id="apCode" style="width:550px"> <pre>
/** Processes this image in row-major order and decreases the
 *  value of each pixel at position (row, col) by the value
 *  of the pixel at position (row + 2, col + 2) if it exists.
 *  Resulting values that would be less than BLACK are replaced
 *  by BLACK. Pixels for which there is no pixel
 *  at position (row + 2, col + 2) are unchanged.
