<h1>Directions</h1>
<p>This question involves the implementation of a fitness tracking system that is represented by the
<span class="cd">StepTracker</span>  class. A <span class="cd">StepTracker</span>  object is created with a parameter that defines the minimum number of steps that must be taken for a day to be considered active.</p>
<p>The <span class="cd">StepTracker</span>  class provides a constructor and the following methods.</p>
<ul id="csList">
<li><p><span class="cd">addDailySteps</span>, which accumulates information about steps, in readings taken once per day</p></li>
</ul>
<ul id="csList">
<li><p><span class="cd">activeDays</span>, which returns the number of active days</p> </li>
</ul>
<ul id="csList">
<li><p><span class="cd">averageSteps</span>, which returns the average number of steps per day, calculated by dividing the total number of steps taken by the number of days tracked</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The following table contains a sample code execution sequence and the corresponding results.</p>
<br>

<h1>Sample Run</h1>
<div id="csSampleRun">
<pre>
Active day consists of at least 10,000 steps.
Current Days Active: 0
Average Number of Steps: 0.0

9000 steps today, not enough to meet active goal.

5000 steps today, not enough to meet active goal.
